# Annotating Genes

## Using downloaded tables

There are lot of nice annotations from The Alliance of Genome Resources <https://www.alliancegenome.org/downloads>. Found out about this because Donna wanted the zebrafish gene descriptions from Zfin and it turns out Zfin pulls from the Alliance

## With `biomaRt`

```{r}
# get the list of datasets, organized by species
biomaRt::listDatasets(biomaRt::useMart("ensembl"))

# load zebrafish data
ensembl <- biomaRt::useEnsembl(biomart = 'genes', dataset = 'drerio_gene_ensembl')

# listAttributes to figure out what the name of the gene descriptions are
biomaRt::listAttributes(ensembl)

biomaRt::getBM(attributes = c('external_gene_name', 'description', 'phenotype_description'),
               mart = ensembl) -> gene_descriptions
```
