View your settings

```bash
git config --list
```
### Set Your Identity

```bash
# set user name and email (directory doesn't matter if you use --global flag because it will automatically write the configuration to ~/.gitconfig)
$ git config --global user.name "Kelsey Keith"
$ git config --global user.email "kkeith@coriell.org"

# check .gitconfig file (from /home/kkeith)
$ more .gitconfig
[user]
	name = Kelsey Keith
	email = kkeith@coriell.org
```
Change editor from emacs to nano

```bash
# set editor for myself globally
$ git config --global core.editor nano

# check .gitconfig file (from /home/kkeith)
$ more .gitconfig
[user]
	name = Kelsey Keith
	email = kkeith@coriell.org
[core]
	editor = nano
```
