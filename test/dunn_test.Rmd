## Dunn Test
*2020-09-03*

Dunn's Test doesn't come with base R, so you have to install a package with the function if it's not already installed. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dunn.test/index.html>

```{r}
install.packages('dunn.test')
```

Demonstrate syntax using the `iris` dataset. (There's no tidy method available in `broom`).

```{r}
iris %>%
# to pipe into dunn.test() have to use .$ in front of the column names
# x = the column from the data you want to test; g = the column of the data
# containing the groups you want to test over. Default p-value, correction 
# method is none, so put "bh" which is Benjamini-Hotchberg which is the same as
# FDR
  dunn.test(x = .$Sepal.Width, g = .$Species, method = 'bh') %>% 
# Turn the result into a table. as.data.frame() works too
  as_tibble() 
```
